									We Need Your Help - Now
								<!-- </a> -->
							</h2>							
							
						</header>
						<p>The long hard effort to create a new curling facility in west end Toronto continues however we are at a critical stage of our project - now.</p>		
						<p>The City of Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Dept (PFR) is currently reviewing their findings regarding the two options they have under consideration.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Convert an existing under-utilized arena into a dedicated curling facility.</li>
							<li>Share an existing arena between curling and the current users of the arena.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>At present, their assessment is before the PFR senior management.  Once that review is complete, the report will be tabled with the City of Toronto’s Economic and Community Development Committee (ECDC) - expected in the next month or two.  After the report is reviewed and possibly modified by the ECDC, it will be presented to Toronto City Council for consideration.  There is no indication of what PFR will put into their report.</p>
						<p>The future of the project will soon be in the hands of the City’s decision makers – our Councillors.  It is important to make sure that our Councillors right across the city know how much curlers throughout the GTA need a new facility.  Councillors must hear this directly from the GTA curlers themselves who have seen too many closures with nothing to replace them.</p>
						<p>We are now asking for your help, the curlers of the GTA, to reach out to</p>	
						<ol>
							<li>The Councillors on the Economic and Community Development Committee <a href="contact.html">(click to see list)</a></li>
							<li>Your local Councillor</li>
							<li>Councillors in your immediate area</li>
							<li>Other Councillors with whom you have dealings</li>
						</ol>	
						<p>While this issue is of prime importance to those of you that reside in the west end of Toronto, it is of great importance to all areas of the city. We need more curling facilities across the city to ensure the long-term health of the sport and this is a first step. Regardless of where you live, we need you to support this issue.</p>
						<p>Follow this <a href="contact.html">link</a> to get more background information on why this is important, what is required and how you can make a difference.  This link includes a template letter that you can use to send to your local councillor and to Mayor Tory.</p>
						<p>We need your help now. Please act quickly.</p>

									Outstanding Response to July's Curling Survey
								<!-- </a> -->
							</h2>							
							
						</header>
						<p>Over 1300 responses -- 656 of which were curlers representing 49% of the total. 88% of curlers preferred the arena refit to the shared use option. (WECC sent our mailer to 700 curlers so to have 656 respond is outstanding)</p>		
							<p>Recall that the Public Online Survey was hosted by the City of Toronto's Park, Forestry and Recreation Dept (PFR) from July 9 to 25, 2021. The survey introduced the Curling Strategy and ongoing work with the public to gather feedback on the two options tabled by PFR (developed through stakeholder engagement):</p>
							<ol>
								<li><b>Convert</b> an under-utilized ice sport arena to dedicated use by curling</li>
								<li><b>Share</b> the use of an under-utilized ice sport arena between curling and the current groups.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>These two options were the two recommended by PFR out of a list of five options that included different forms of new curling facilities.</p>
							<p>Click here to download and read the full <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8cf8-curling-strategy-survey-summary-july-2021.pdf">survey summary</a>.</p>
							<p>It is a large 99-page document with high level summaries and individual (anonymous) comments. If you have a free hour or more, grab yourself a coffee, iced tea or other beverage and read the responses tabled on pages 18-98. This is an interesting read. Bear in mind, the city sent this survey to all users & renters of the arenas in the west end, not just the seven flagged as under-utilized, so some of the comments will be from those who use and enjoy a very full and busy arena.</p>
							<p>We will be in touch to advise you of the next steps! Enjoy what's left of summer.</p>

									August 2021 Update and Next Steps
								<!-- </a> -->
							</h2>							
							
						</header>
						<p>The City of Toronto's Parks, Forestry, and Recreation (PFR) Dept continued to assess their two remaining options identified to help meet the demand for curling opportunities in West Toronto.</p>		
							
							<ol>
								<li>Conversion of an existing arena to dedicated curling use</li>
								<li>Shared use of an existing arena with the current arena users</li>
							</ol>
							<p>PFR has conducted consultations with existing users of the city-owned single-pad arenas which were flagged as under-utilized. The key finding of those consultations is that the current arena users have many concerns regarding both options. Essentially, new curlers and existing ice sport participants would be competing for the same limited resource. A few of the concerns raised were a loss of access to the ice for existing programs, diminished quality of ice where ice sharing is done, breaking of existing links to communities, and others.</p>
							
							<h4>What's next for PFR</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>PFR will complete their assessment of the consultation results.</li>
								<li>PFR will create their report for presentation to the Economic and Community Development Committee (ECDC) at its October meeting.</li>
								<li>A week before the report goes to the ECDC, it will be posted for the public viewing however changes will likely not be possible.</li>
								<li>After the report goes to the ECDC, it will go to Toronto City Council.</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>What's next for the West End Curling Committee (WECC)</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>WECC will develop a strategy for the next two months leading up to the report going to the ECDC.</li>
								<li>WECC will seek input from our Stakeholders and others to ensure the message that is presented to the ECDC and the full Toronto City Council will completely reflect the needs of curlers in West Toronto.</li>

									City of Toronto Hosts Curling Meeting
								<!-- </a> -->
							</h2>							
							
						</header>
						<p>As most of you who follow this website know, for the past two years a group called the West End Curling Committee (WECC) has been working hard on getting a new curling facility in west Toronto.  For much of that time, WECC has been working with the City of Toronto's Parks, Forestry and Recreation (PFR) Dept.</p>		
							<p>The latest step in the process is that PFR is holding an on-line Public Consultation meeting scheduled for July 15, 2021.  PFR is also doing an associated survey.  Details are below and at the City website (see the link attached - once there, look under "Get Involved").  This meeting & survey is open to anyone who has an interest in the future or curling in Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area.  </p>
							
							<p>You can help get the much needed, new curling facility in west Toronto by participating in the meeting and survey as well as forwarding this to as many of your curling contacts as possible.  Suggest they participate...and that they pass it along in turn to their curling network, etc.</p>
							
							<p>Even if you do not reside in west Toronto, remember - what is good for west Toronto, is good for curling across the GTA and in our region.  We have lost too many curling facilities.  PFR needs to see the level of support for curling in west Toronto.</p>

									City of Toronto Parks, Forestry, and Recreation Department's Curling Strategy, Interim Phase 2 Report
								<!-- </a> -->
							</h2>							
						</header>
						<p>The City of Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation (PFR) published their Interim Phase 2 Report as part of their Curling Strategy (see link below).  This report identifies options to meet the demand for curling identified in the Phase 1 Report published in the summer of 2020.</p>		
							<a href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/construction-new-facilities/parks-facility-plans-strategies/curling-strategy">Phase 2 Report</a>
							<br>
							<br>
							<p>This Phase 2 report is very good news.</p>
							
							<p>It reflects the work that PFR has done along with the Stakeholders Group to keep this important project moving forward despite the impact COVID-19 has on us all.  Publishing this report announces to the curling community in Toronto that while the project has been delayed, it is still very much active and has  PFR’s commitment to see the analysis through to completion.</p>
							
							<p>We continue to move closer to the new facility we need in west Toronto however there are major challenges ahead including the final search for a preferred design option, selection of a specific site, funding options, when the final proposal will go to Toronto City Council for approval.  PFR is planning the next Stakeholders Group meeting near the end of February to discuss these challenges.</p>

									City of Toronto Parks, Forestry, and Recreation (PFR) Department's Curling Strategy Metting
								<!-- </a> -->
							</h2>							
						</header>
						<p>Another milestone in our project was reached on Tuesday, Sept. 29th with the City of Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation's (PFR) Phase 2 meeting with its Stakeholders Reference Group. This is a group of knowledgeable curling spokespersons who provide PFR with direction and expertise on the sport within Toronto.</p>
							<br>
						<p>The purpose of the meeting was to build upon the positive findings from Phase 1 which determined there were serious gaps in meeting the demand for curling in Toronto and in particular the west end of Toronto. PFR wanted to gather input on the first draft of their Phase 2 report - finding viable options for closing the gaps identified in Phase 1. Phase 2 will also determine costs and funding options.</p>
							<br>
						<p>The detailed content of the meeting must remain confidential at the request of PFR until Phase 2 is complete and the ultimate report is posted for public viewing.</p>
							<br>
						<p>Here are a few general highlights without getting into specifics -</p>
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>It was a very professional and well run event.</li>
							<li>PFR restated that there are gaps in meeting the demand for curling. They were still supportive and committed to the project.</li>
							<li>Curling "Models" were reviewed. These are the various ways a new curling facility might be managed.</li>
							<li>Facility options were presented alsong with assessment criteria. This all aligned very well to the range of options that we developed within WECC. At this stage the options are still quite general.</li>
							<li>PFR also presented criteria which will help assess locations for any facility.</li>
						</ul>	
						<br>
						<p>It must be stressed that this is very preliminary and it is not a given that any option will meet the criteria presented. There is much work left to do.</p>
						<br>
						<p>A follow-up meeting will be setup by PFR in early December to explore these options and locations in more detail in order to complete this phase of the project.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Once completed, the Phase 2 report will be brought before City Council. The original target for going to City Council was the 4th quarter of 2020. However, due to delays including COVID-19, the report will likely not go to City Council until the beginning of 2021.</p>
						<br>
						<p>The project is moving in a good direction.</p>

									Parks, Forestry, and Recreation (PFR) has Published the Final Phase 1 Report on their Curling Assessment
								<!-- </a> -->
							</h2>							
						</header>
						<p>This includes the high level go forward plans on Phase 2 and lastly the Reporting Out Phase to Toronto City Council.</p>
						<p><strong>Phase 1</strong> (determine gaps, trends and opportunities): The official Phase 1 report was published on the City website on Friday Aug. 14, 2020  A link to the report was sent out to all of our WECC Stakeholders and is included below for general viewing.  WECC is very encouraged by the findings of the report. WECC's assessment is that the report demonstrates a strong need for additional curling facilities, not only in the west end but also across the city. It is a strong foundation for Phase 2.</p>
						<a href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/construction-new-facilities/parks-facility-plans-strategies/curling-strategy/"><strong>Toronto Curling Strategy Website</strong></a>
							<br>
							<br>
						<p>We must bear in mind that this is just the assessment of <strong>needs</strong>. While critically important, there is much more work required to create a new curling facility.</p>
							<br>
						<p><strong>Phase 2</strong> (how to address the gaps - structures, locations, costs and funding): This phase will determine the viability of creating the physical curling facility. Obviously it is critical. PFR has set Sept 29 has the date of the next PFR stakeholders meeting. The exact process PFR will follow has not yet been announced. WECC will continue to share our existing material on these topics from our work done over the past year. </p>
							<br>
						<p><strong>Reporting Out/Phase 3</strong> (create final recommendation with full detail and present to city council). The target is December and a vote in City Council on any recommendations. To be become reality, Councillors must vote “yes” to a new facility. Leading up to this final presentation of the report and the subsequent vote on it, it is critical that all those across the city who believe curling needs to grow with the creation of additional facilities must express their support for the project with their local City Councillor.</p>

									PFR has received the green light to set up a Stakeholder Reference Group meeting. This is the second phase. In light of the COVID-19 restrictions, they're working

									Note from Bill Baker, Chairperson of the 125th TCA Goldline Men’s Curling Championships
								<!-- </a> -->
							</h2>							
						</header>
						<p>The 125th TCA Goldline Men’s Curling Championships wound up last weekend. I think
							everyone involved enjoyed the tournament and it ran with very few problems thanks to my
							great committee and the help from the 14 different curling facilities we used through the
							week.
							We had 216 teams entered this year, which is down by 2 teams from last year. Unfortunately
							we had teams on a wait list that we could not accommodate because we had used up all of
							the available ice in the city!
							<br>
							<br>
							With the recent closure of the curling sections at Scarboro Golf & Country Club and Weston
							Golf & Country Club, and the announcement that this is the final year for curling at St.
							George’s Golf & Country Club, we have a serious problem here in the GTA. There are simply
							not enough curling facilities in the city for the demand. This problem will continue to impact
							the tournament I run, but more importantly will limit our ability to introduce this sport to the
							growing number of interested participants in the city.
							<br>
							<br>
							The interest in curling is growing around the world. Here in the GTA clubs that hold “Learn to
							Curl” sessions report large numbers of attendees. These clubs are then challenged to find
							these prospective curlers spots in their leagues to participate.
							We need new curling faculties in the GTA.
							<br>
							<br>
							The West End Curling Committee (westendcurling.com) was formed to try and address this
							issue as the west end of the GTA is in the greatest need. After this year there will be no
							curling facilities in the west end of the city of Toronto beyond High Park.

									Encouraging First Assessment Meeting with City of Toronto

						<p>On December 20th, WECC met with Councillor Holyday, Parks and Rec staff, and City Planning staff. You may remember at the City of Toronto Executive Committee meeting
							held in October that we won the support of Mayor Tory and the Executive Committee. The Mayor tabled a motion requesting the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Department to
							work with WECC in assessing what is needed to address the crisis in curling in West Toronto. We were truly encouraged to hear Councillor Holyday and the city staffers have an appreciation for the situation.
							There is much work to do, but we are ready to do whatever is needed!
						</p>
												
						<p>
							One thing we know for sure is that when this goes to Council it will be a city wide initiative and we need <strong>ALL councilors</strong> on board not just those in Etobicoke. So, for our New Year's
							wish we ask each and every one of you to please call, email or write to your councilor. A copy of a sample letter is <a href="assets/files/template_letter.docx" download="" target="_blank">available here</a> for your use.

									Fund-Raiser Bonspiel - A Huge Success!

						<p>On Saturday November 23rd, St. George's Curling Club hosted the first WECC Fund-Raiser Bonspiel. What a great day. We had teams from all over the GTA, 12 teams in total, 48 people, and many others who attended for lunch. Thank you to all the people who came in support of the work WECC is doing to create a new curling facility in the West End. The money raised will help toward the cost of the project going forward.</p>
												
						<p>
							It was a real bonus to have Councillor Stephen Holyday attend. He had an opportunity to meet a variety of curlers and heard their stories about why curling is important to them. 
							<br>
							<br>
							A particular thank you to Bonnie Sacchetti and her organizing group.

									Kraft Heinz Project Play Update

						<p>
							Many of you know WECC entered the Kraft Heinz Project Play Contest which was offering $250,000 to the winning project. Our project was called Etobicoke Curling Centre and was competing against many other projects from across Canada. Over the past couple of months supporters of our project have been submitting photos and stories making the case for our project to make it to the next round - the final four projects and the ultimate final vote to pick a single winner.
							<br>
							<!-- <a href="single.html" class="more-link">Continue reading</a> -->
						</p>
						<p>
							Some of you might already know our Etobicoke Curling Centre missed the cut for the final four projects.
							<br>
						</p>
						<p>
							Dissapointing news of course, however we knew our project was stretching the limits of the scope of this contest. The projects selected are strong contenders and have a shorter time horizon than ours. But still, you miss every shot you don't take and so we had to take a shot.
							<br>
						</p>
						<p>
							We have captured all the stories and photos from the website in case the organizers start to purge content. The stories are wonderful and we can re-use these stories in our future efforts. It is important to realize the 29 stories submitted by our supporters demonstrated such heartfelt emotions toward curling in general and to our project specifically that it has made the whole process worthwhile. We won in a different way. If you want to be inspiried, go to the <a href="https://www.kraftheinzprojectplay.com/#community/11E9D3EADB2E66909B7FF77585825E67">Kraft Heinz website</a> and re-read our stories under our project.
							<br>
						</p>
						<p>
							WECC thanks everyone who took the time and made the effort to submit a story. You spoke with eloquence and conviction. Well done. And now it is back to work and we have much work to do.
