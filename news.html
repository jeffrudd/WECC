									Parks, Forestry, and Recreation (PFR) has Published the Final Phase 1 Report on their Curling Assessment
								<!-- </a> -->
							</h2>							
						</header>
						<p>This includes the high level go forward plans on Phase 2 and lastly the Reporting Out Phase to Toronto City Council.</p>
						<p><strong>Phase 1</strong> (determine gaps, trends and opportunities): The official Phase 1 report was published on the City website on Friday Aug. 14, 2020  A link to the report was sent out to all of our WECC Stakeholders and is included below for general viewing.  WECC is very encouraged by the findings of the report. WECC's assessment is that the report demonstrates a strong need for additional curling facilities, not only in the west end but also across the city. It is a strong foundation for Phase 2.</p>
						<a href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/construction-new-facilities/parks-facility-plans-strategies/curling-strategy/"><strong>Toronto Curling Strategy Website</strong></a>
							<br>
							<br>
						<p>We must bear in mind that this is just the assessment of <strong>needs</strong>. While critically important, there is much more work required to create a new curling facility.</p>
							<br>
						<p><strong>Phase 2</strong> (how to address the gaps - structures, locations, costs and funding): This phase will determine the viability of creating the physical curling facility. Obviously it is critical. PFR has set Sept 29 has the date of the next PFR stakeholders meeting. The exact process PFR will follow has not yet been announced. WECC will continue to share our existing material on these topics from our work done over the past year. </p>
							<br>
						<p><strong>Reporting Out/Phase 3</strong> (create final recommendation with full detail and present to city council). The target is December and a vote in City Council on any recommendations. To be become reality, Councillors must vote “yes” to a new facility. Leading up to this final presentation of the report and the subsequent vote on it, it is critical that all those across the city who believe curling needs to grow with the creation of additional facilities must express their support for the project with their local City Councillor.</p>

							<p>PFR (Parks, Forestry & Recreation) completes the first phase of their Curling Assessment - the interviews with the curling club managers and other club contacts to 
									understand the current situation, membership issues and trends.
									<br>
									<br>
									PFR has received the green light to set up a Stakeholder Reference Group meeting. This is the second phase. In light of the COVID-19 restrictions, they're working
									with colleagues at the City to convene this via a digital formate, likely WebEx. This approach is new for them and they still have some details to work out.
									<br>
									<br>
									All things considered, given the impact of COVID-19, PFR is doing well to stay rough on schedule. They are not suggesting any change to the Q4 target for their report.

									City of Toronto Creates Curling Strategy Website
								<!-- </a> -->
							</h2>							
						</header>
						<p>As part of the City of Toronto’s Parks, Forestry and Recreation Department’s assessment of curling in
							Toronto, they have created a new curling specific website. This is for all community members to log
							their comments, suggestions, needs, and preferences as it relates to adding greater curling capacity in
							Toronto. This is especially important for Toronto’s west end which in the greatest need. The new
							website is a direct line to the Parks, Forestry and Recreation Department and is dedicated to this
							project.<strong> Have your say now by taking this link:</strong></p>
						<a href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/construction-new-facilities/parksfacility-plans-strategies/curling-strategy/"><strong>Toronto Curling Strategy Website</strong></a>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p><strong>Note,</strong> this does not replace contact you should have with your local elected officials on this project.
							Those local elected officials still represent your needs and you should contact them directly since at
							some point in the future the city councillors will be voting on the matter of a new curling facility
							assuming Parks, Forestry and Recreation recommend that. We need that vote to be “YES”. To find
							tips and links to help you do this, follow this link to the WECC <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page</p>

									Note from Bill Baker, Chairperson of the 125th TCA Goldline Men’s Curling Championships
								<!-- </a> -->
							</h2>							
						</header>
						<p>The 125th TCA Goldline Men’s Curling Championships wound up last weekend. I think
							everyone involved enjoyed the tournament and it ran with very few problems thanks to my
							great committee and the help from the 14 different curling facilities we used through the
							week.
							We had 216 teams entered this year, which is down by 2 teams from last year. Unfortunately
							we had teams on a wait list that we could not accommodate because we had used up all of
							the available ice in the city!
							<br>
							<br>
							With the recent closure of the curling sections at Scarboro Golf & Country Club and Weston
							Golf & Country Club, and the announcement that this is the final year for curling at St.
							George’s Golf & Country Club, we have a serious problem here in the GTA. There are simply
							not enough curling facilities in the city for the demand. This problem will continue to impact
							the tournament I run, but more importantly will limit our ability to introduce this sport to the
							growing number of interested participants in the city.
							<br>
							<br>
							The interest in curling is growing around the world. Here in the GTA clubs that hold “Learn to
							Curl” sessions report large numbers of attendees. These clubs are then challenged to find
							these prospective curlers spots in their leagues to participate.
							We need new curling faculties in the GTA.
							<br>
							<br>
							The West End Curling Committee (westendcurling.com) was formed to try and address this
							issue as the west end of the GTA is in the greatest need. After this year there will be no
							curling facilities in the west end of the city of Toronto beyond High Park.

						<p>On December 20th, WECC met with Councillor Holyday, Parks and Rec staff, and City Planning staff. You may remember at the City of Toronto Executive Committee meeting

							One thing we know for sure is that when this goes to Council it will be a city wide initiative and we need <strong>ALL councilors</strong> on board not just those in Etobicoke. So, for our New Year's

							Many of you know WECC entered the Kraft Heinz Project Play Contest which was offering $250,000 to the winning project. Our project was called Etobicoke Curling Centre and was competing against many other projects from across Canada. Over the past couple of months supporters of our project have been submitting photos and stories making the case for our project to make it to the next round - the final four projects and the ultimate final vote to pick a single winner.
							<br>
							<!-- <a href="single.html" class="more-link">Continue reading</a> -->
						</p>
						<p>
							Some of you might already know our Etobicoke Curling Centre missed the cut for the final four projects.
							<br>
						</p>
						<p>
							Dissapointing news of course, however we knew our project was stretching the limits of the scope of this contest. The projects selected are strong contenders and have a shorter time horizon than ours. But still, you miss every shot you don't take and so we had to take a shot.
							<br>
						</p>
						<p>
							We have captured all the stories and photos from the website in case the organizers start to purge content. The stories are wonderful and we can re-use these stories in our future efforts. It is important to realize the 29 stories submitted by our supporters demonstrated such heartfelt emotions toward curling in general and to our project specifically that it has made the whole process worthwhile. We won in a different way. If you want to be inspiried, go to the <a href="https://www.kraftheinzprojectplay.com/#community/11E9D3EADB2E66909B7FF77585825E67">Kraft Heinz website</a> and re-read our stories under our project.
							<br>
						</p>
						<p>
							WECC thanks everyone who took the time and made the effort to submit a story. You spoke with eloquence and conviction. Well done. And now it is back to work and we have much work to do.
